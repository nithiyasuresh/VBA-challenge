# VBA-challenge
The script was developed on a steop by step basis with BCS assistants help.
Sorted the ticker column first, created a module for ticker
      1. declaring ticker as integer
      2. Identifying where the data has to be taken from
      3. giving ticker a column to populate, while also finding the next values and populating all different tickers.
As the ticker populated in 1 sheet, tried to get it across multiple sheets, giving in the code for the data to appear on multiple sheets.
Going through to creating another module of populating yearly_change for the given data, across sheet.
      1. Declaring yearly_change, opening_price, closing_price
      2. Identifying where the data has to be taken from
      3. Assigning a column name for yearly_change to appear.
Next step was to calculate the percentage on the basis of yearly_change and opening_price
      1. Declaring percentage, opening_price
      2. Identifying where the data has to be taken from
      3. Assigning a column name for percentage to appear.
    PS: Most of the code used when calculating yearly_change, and percentage were the same, and also to calculate percentage, i needed the yearly_change column.  Hence clubbed all the modules into 1 module, and continued with next steps.
Next is to calculate the stock_volume and populate in the respective column.
      1. Declaring stock_volume
      2. Identifying where the data has to be taken from
      3. Assigning a column name for stock_volume to appear.
Checked all the above columns are calculated and populated in the respective columns across sheets.
As the columns appeared, worked on the formatting for yearly_change and percentage columns.
Created yearly_change formatting code first, to test that the formatting appears right, then created the formatting for perentage column.
